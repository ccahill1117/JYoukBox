#### Scott Bergler, Chris Cahill & Ryan Leslie

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a Spotify-like song/video player. A user can create/generate a list of media to play. It will play through that list and the user can continue to add to the list as it plays. Ultimately, we would like multiple users to be able to add to the list from their own devices (tablets, phones, etc.).

### Specifications:
##### Spec 1: Create a song object:

##### Spec 3: Add song to play queue:
- [ ] **Expect:** input: a song/output: song added to queue;

##### Spec 4: console.log queue:
- [ ] **Expect:** input: console.log(queue)/output: list of songs added to queue;
